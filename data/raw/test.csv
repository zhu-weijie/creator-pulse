this just being overly dramatic the ramblings the uae foreign minister few months ago about the yemen participation pakistan was just done pressure pakistan into completely aligning with the gulf uae does not and will not make political statements that aren backed the rest the khaleeji countries suggest that uae pursuing more india focused diplomacy political future not true true from purely business perspective which happens the only thing uae rulers care about terms india pakistan relations the whole gwadar port business has pissed off these city states and they are pressuring pakistan abandon since will hurt them economically the use such politics just mask the real issue they have with the port the vague and contradictory stands pakistan and turkey are absolute proof that arab security — from libya yemen — the responsibility none but arab countries that statement cute the gulf arab countries have always relied pakistan for their security and have been the biggest contributor besides usa their protection have been training their previously non existent armies and are still doing that india will always try undermine pakistani interests but there reason believe the gulf will turns towards india other than for business they simply cannot that even they wanted ,1

 generally agree fan religious ideology any sense can hard have the conversation about problems with ideology without that creeping include people individuals general read that islam espouses some shitty things and shouldn act like that isn problem say the same thing when christin extremists bomb abortion clinics both have problematic language and views think the differentiating factor that islam codified the law islamic nations the beliefs are backed the force law most western christin majority nations the law mainly secular you can still get really poisonous messages about homosexually but the law punishes you for acting rather than protecting our directly participating think have fewer problems without the theocracy but nothing going stop guy who decided needs off bunch people finds repulsive and that brings arguments over gun control which while different thing but have large segments the public who won even have the discussion ,1

hey thanks for the ama found your channel after watching the unacademy videos that you were and was surprised see many bhakts the comment section here are questions know that you have made several videos the propaganda news channels the facts there cannot more true but can you tell some printed news media that are unbiased that can rely for news without getting pasted propaganda and pseudo development goals the most common question here how you deal with all the death threats and are you your parents targeted recognised any way when you are india which political party you think will best for india years down the line and what party will die out assuming that similar trends continues that are happening now while there are many ways but what the best way can trigger bhakt will you make videos topics that are not political but deals with burning issues randia thinks that your tweet about this ama can bring bjp cell here think they will overwhelmed the interface love your videos man goodluck with the presentation also flair inspired that video ,1

definitely fact there are least couple ways you could one way would coordinate each recitation with one breath then you using mala you would move forward one bead another way way that prefer fact coordinate one breath with recitations ymmv but for this usually means recitations the breath and recitations the out breath after one breath you move one bead forward this takes significantly longer one mala but the time you are done you have done 1000 recitations there are also many other things you can combine recitation with prostrations visualization listening the sound the recitation itself contemplation koan like who who now recites the buddha name and walking meditation fact you could even combine walking breathing and recitation the nembutsu very flexible practice experiment with and see what works for you ,1

 top vijay mallya just resigned from united spirits and got payout million rs515cr not pedantic but couldn resist because intermittent ocd sorry how can they ask the banks waive off loans worth lakhs crores without having estimate how the big defaulters are the banks know who are the borrowers and rbi does not this not issue secondly the loans are not being waived cancelled forgiven forgotten that wrong and dangerous word use this context the loans are being written off what that means you say earlier you post that once the borrower has failed service the loan willingly due the things can control the banks write off called provisioning could partial full that their and balance sheet show the true reflection their own health rajan pushing for aggressive approach you mention later the post that does not mean that the borrower walks away the banks continue make efforts recover the money through notices public shaming selling assets borrower change management restructuring conversion into equity court cases sale loan arcs etc loan part that has been written off the bank and the bank manages recover the amount written back and becomes profit for that year interesting example here would the business cycle mid 90s early 2000s that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually worse shape than today but fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most the bank clients turned around and banks averted disaster most borrowers were commodity companies that time steel cement etc this time this not likely happen the mess wouldn clear itself they could have taken measure make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money not only did they not take these measures they actually forced the banks lend their favored borrowers one the biggest defaulter unitech which people say gandhi family company rumor don ask for source group another big defaulter was close bsp jindals congress hcc pawar dlf huda vadra and they will benefit immensely from this loan write off and bailouts the government banks play the book which big ask they need not seize their fucking assets they have given personal guarantee seize their homes too what happens next short term government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive medium term hopefully this government puts professional management into the top layers the bank board and cmd and the rot contained happening bank baroda but again tall ask long term the relative size the psu bank will shrink pvt banks will become bigger one last point why are politicians reluctant reforming privatizing the banks because that the biggest tool granting favors corporates who turn are the biggest political donors the last last point there silver lining the bank problem stock problem the loans already given are going bad and need deal with what the system does not have fortunately the flow problem new money coming into the system and the investment cycle picks will have the money fund ,1

such intolerance not new back the 90s when was high school were visiting small town tamil nadu and out shopping with some friends and made funny comment reference jayalalitha shop and was immediately told hush our hosts and once reached home was told that you shouldn say negative things about any politician public because their supporters are mostly goons who would cause problems having grown big city and school where regularly talked about current affairs and the first few minutes the school day were spent discussing the days top news stories was complete shock that you could get into trouble for merely speaking out and then ended moving tamil nadu for college and learnt that you should careful about criticising any tamil movies either you risked running into some violent fans the actors was happy move out there and have not have been the kind social circles where don have worry about speaking mind over the last few years social media has changed all that first started with iac and aap questioning anything about anna hazare and his lokpal was primarily met with name calling once aap came around got worse and then the 2014 campaign started and things just went rapidly downhill during the same period year period our cities have grown rapidly due immigration from smaller towns and villages and internet access which was mostly limited the urban elite became affordable the common man and this kind polarised say anything against favorite leader actor etc and round gang thugs and rough you scenario what most those people grew and for them this par for the course for political discourse and even though they have just found new medium express their views the way they remains the same the moderates will always just fly under the radar and avoid engaging with such elements look the bihar verdict bjp propaganda and their fanbois propagating would have you believe that modi and his plan the only way forward and anyone even questioning anti national and even the exit polls seemed endorse the view that this view was resonating with the population because only people already vocal about their views would readily submit any exit poll but the final results clearly showed that they were all wrong and the majority don care about this brand politics propaganda also there eleanor rooselvent quote great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people when have such large chunk the population that barely literate and education system that penalises independent thought you cannot expect have any kind normal debate policies plans with the average indian who raised never question authority status quo but they are definitely smart enough discuss events and how impacts them and react accordingly ,1

 few bad people does bad thing entire community suffers the consequences humans are well known stereotype people and categorize people their minds based what they think those category people doesn have right all yet people are stupid enough that for example many people categorize women into separate category and stereotype them into thinking women should only this are expected xyz thing another example men must not cry now those were categorization based gender now there are categorization based all types things from skin color religion country wealth education job caste etc many people darker skin color still face discrimination lot countries example job based discrimination many people consider babas scamsters because several high profile babas getting into scandals that doesn mean there aren good babas out there doing real good work then criticize politicians singular category ohh politician must corrupt then criticize successful industrialists what jerk for having much wealth must have got cheating people all these categorization are bad and should not exist the ideal world but they people are stupid they make these things their mind you fall into any these categories then you suffer the consequences what other people with similar categories have done case muslims and hindus divide all started during the partition and the struggle after that millions people died people who survived will tell their children stories how evil that muslim hindu was who killed your grandpa this make the kids have distorted view the world where person that religion default huge boogeyman and due lack consistent interaction childhood the child grows with those thoughts his mind then each event which come across will categorize his mind ohh that person that religion did this this increases into hatred these issues get amplified someone that category does something really really bad which gets lot media attention this how feminists word for people advocating for equality gender suddenly started looking like negative word because actions few people who claimed feminist was bad that now people think all feminists are bad case muslims the current running stereotype around the world the association lot terrorist organizations with islam this makes people put people associate that with the stereotype sure there are terrorist organizations who are from other religions well but that not the point here people will see the attack and see the religion and just assume both are correlated together next time they come across someone who has those religion they becomes slightly suspicious the online world especially reddit where everyone anonymous these kinda suspicions get openly discussed and people become complete racists sexists and all other kind bad things have lot friends who are various religions including yours don care about religion care about what kinda person you are guess being someone from kerala also have something with this here did not have much inter religion struggle like what northern india had face during partition this means that people here generally not care about religion this means childhood where you get interact with people all backgrounds and thus such kinda hatred not there ,-1

most religions have dogmatic orthodox well esoteric philosophic side the christian heaven can seen palace the clouds state mind rebirth buddhism can seen fact just superstition left over from other beliefs you interpret and understand you see fit like think about various religions talking about the same thing using different words and yes cherry pick what believe but honestly and very carefully think better than taking everything religion says and rejecting everything doesn say there must hundred different ways talk about enlightenment heaven pure land individuation alchemy rites passage education trials meditation the tricky part that what describes can easily explained words and most importantly has understood which different than just knowing reading about the pure land real place state mind doubt real place but sure some will believe buddhism has some dogma but not nearly much eastern religions ,1
 you want stand stand you want sit sit but whatever you don wobble what you gotta make yourself happy don take the teachings seriously sometimes make mistakes and sometimes fuck for long time but with right intention most likely come back the practice would personally say that the adult webcam job probably contradicts buddhist practice but seems you enjoying there problem but perhaps you should spend some time alone asking yourself you really enjoy and want continue sometimes don realise that don actually want something until stop and think about thich naht hahn once said woman who had alcohol problems and couldn seem quit long enough gain any positive outcomes that she should stop trying quit for herself and quit for those around her who have problems with alcohol that mind set certainly helped give alcohol and drugs drink and drugs are great fun but unfortunately there are those out there who have serious problems with them and when drank took drugs the past felt was supporting those addicts not helping them but encouraging them stopped for them perhaps you could think the adult webcam job similar way what you doing helping others giving something positive the world linked world sexual misconduct abuse and harrassment ,1

personally think that this whole muslim apologist thing has been created the media and has gone far enough you should look certain businesses that only muslims run and hindu never into them like leather meat bakery etc then why don you say muslims are victimized and frankly the western media that doesn want hindu muslim peace indians don really care except very few which are there all religions whether someone hindu muslim this wedge created the british unfortunately has lasted till today and due backward thinking people will last longer high time that people realize that most indians hindus aren discriminating based religion ,1

ugh fairly new politics have been modi supporter anymore though cast first vote 2019 used laugh rahul but never hated him and this isn the case now prefer rahul over modi simply because hate modi rahul maybe son nepotism but you look the other side actually educated humble accepts his mistakes and team man and all these qualities are absent modi who basically one man government and narcissist pathetic liar and seems quite arrogant policies like demonitization are another reason and keeping mind most his other policies are well advertised and renamed policies upa often fail see the talent one might see congress fail spot leaders like tharoor mms bjp and doubt their approach stuff like not appointing lokpal even after having absolute majority and frca and finance bill makes you question they actually want work for the country haven even talked about communalism yet have seen people change their stance and hate certain minorities more after 2014 than before hating minorities muslims common and such people are often modi supporters and such statements from the bjp members also sufficiate point one might say that have seen more worse under congress 1984 and all but probably because congress has been power more the anti muslim stand bjp isn the same with congress not their idealogy yes they minority appeasement times but they are still more secular than bjp imagine muslim leader from bjp rss nearby future seems quite unlikely while saw mms from congress even after what happened sikh riots have typed lot and not all just get the gist ,-1

 going churlish and ahead and puncture your baloon one pointby one point certain that turnout this election result whole india against corruption movement even people who gave their votes bjp congress must have awakened aap some way turn out 2013 assembly elections highest ever assembly election history turn out rajasthan 2013 assembly elections highest ever state history 2013 turn out karnataka 2013 2013 despite what you might think voter turn out and interest politics amongst the young the middle class and the hitherto not interested educated masses not aap doing sure the iac movement anna hazare movement did raise lot eyeballs did the protests for nirbhaya but aap did jacksquat outside delhi heck fail get why you folks don understand core issue aap will non existent outside the ncr and maybe punjab they are non entity the south and west even the cities and the hinterland where some our population resides they are absolutely unknown but lets face aap much better opposition than inc for bjp absolutey not let paraphrase person you must dislike lot modi arnab interview said stuff said the heat the election campaign momentary run nation need the assistance every single party every single politics involves the art give and take negotiation and even the shitty congress stood firmly behind the nda when came pokhran 814 the flight kandahar the nda backed the congress some bills aap will not that they are immature and think any give and take the sign corruption and collusion aap will make for shitty opposition shittier ruling party and maybe fit only dharnas and make wild allegations none which will ever taken forward proven like the discoms ambani swiss bank accounts the hundred other baseless allegations they have made winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents most knew time has came for congress either change die forever aap has risen become worthy opponent don believe these poll results for aap just ridiculous that even after delhi mistake they under estimate aap wrong electoral politics only winning counts and what this ridicuolous logic you guys have convinced yourself about the congress not dying did not die did not die 2004 will still the second largest party will still rule odd major states this country will still command minimum vote share nationally can summon allies deadlock parliament needs has money has power has connections has pull the media you think congress dying you are absolutely wrong wait for aap shatter over the next years that bound happen but congress will remain wouldn even surprised pappu mrs vadra came power either 2019 2024 the least upa coming back power aap supporters are naive leaders when comes real politik atleast the way leaders potray themselves also delhi 2013 not the rest india heck delhi 2014 not delhi 2013 mark words again this aap will the second largest party with about seats the delhi assembly 2014 for jlp they will end losing everything state centre and goodwill the people thinking about this scenario with eye future see bad times why party getting much ridiculed for cleaning politics what load rubbish what cleaning parties aap did the following subsidy raj hooliganism only smaller reach they are smaller party endless political drama the cost governance what the difference between mamta not doing anything bengal and claiming moist conspiracy and ak49 doing nothing and claiming the bjp ambani hand behind their absolute non performance associating with absolute communal muslims like taufeeq raza guy who ordered taslima beheaded jamiat islami hind the name being secular aap saar the exact replica the congress bsp tmc they have huge corruption scams their name yet did tmc have the taint scams till took power give time the average aap neta will also very similar the average political goon why you people have forgotten inc they are responsible that are where were yrs back like that india will not like where maya and mulayam romance people alternately lmao truly lmao aap forgot inc real life where ak49 has not mentioned the name rajmata her brood even once publicly except when last minute added her name his list corrupt even these forums which amount nothing irl have seen this behaviour aap aap leaders and followers who skewed the debate away from inc and failures into making some mission stop one man who the least corrupt big margin amongst leaders india today anything aap had virulently campaigned amongst support base small group educated urban indians against the inc the approx vote share would have also come the bjp and might have resulted lesser seats the inc and maybe maybe truly weakend that party but nope you guys had skew the debate away from your handlers ak49 janpath agree wholeheartedly with you the rest your post about keeping clean clarify this post not addressed you individually but the larger superset aap followers here mean offense you and post has hurt you any way please accept apologies lastly still think the exit polls are absolutely horrendously over bloated towards the nda and the nda crowning not certain and aap feel will get seats and not back empty handed fingers crossed ninja edit typos spelling mistakes etc long post didn truly clean all that said surprised you left out bjp and modi efforts rallying the masses that man accomplished some herculean stuff according the latest india today report has directly participated some 500 speeches been part holograms chai charcha etc some 000 has travelled some 000 and apparently met reached out the total bloody electorate you might dislike him you might hate him but you might want respect him his professionalism single minded focus and absolute bloodymindedness the face opposition from almost all other parties across india and about the sucession plans premature though they may the bjp for all the faults non bjp supporters find with truly democratic meritocratic party and the distant future get parikkar chouhan would say they are arguably the best this country lead aside from amma but meh her corruption and arrogance will come her way ,1

 not going into the fact that you probably incorrect assuming that white people treat their minorities better than every other respective ethnic backgrounds lot these sources seem very cherry picked but going off the assumption that you correct going with the assumption that you talking about racial minorities instead something like religion since the point you bring specifically white people might have with the quantity minorities for example asian countries the number minorities are insignificant south korea they have minority percentage compare that place like the where the country are part minority ethnicity obviously these are very specific places but places like india might have religious intolerance but seem not even count people different races living there minorities what getting feel like you really need more thorough unbiased research some countries have more tolerance other religions but less races some are the opposite putting down the very specific white people treat other minorities better than other racial backgrounds but then comparing place like indias treatment people certain religious background instead racial seems very cherry picked you are very vague when you say western white people which encompasses huge variety countries but then you specify few countries that aren western white this isn very controlled research for the rest the countries consider looking into racial treatment minorities countries that aren predominantly white but also considered modern first world country using modern first world country like the picking this one since you named countries that are western white yourself and comparing place like afghanistan like comparing apples oranges ,1

they are the textbook definition terror group look the wiki definition terrorism the unlawful use violence and intimidation especially against civilians the pursuit political aims does the rss fit under this category let see consider then that this the most powerful non state outfit india with real opposition besides the police theory consider then that pursuit their aims the group has spawned multiple sub groups which are far more violent than they are their student wing the abvp has strong history intimidation the bajrang dal are notorious the vhp even more together talking about millions members qaeda its peak has some 000 today given their size reach and degree cultural intimidation they genuinely strike terror across india the last years people have started getting afraid voicing themselves saying certain things doing certain things certain days day supporting certain parties public sure the right will disagree and come with reasons why rss isn close something like jem that why sticking the idea terror itself boils down one fundamental difference indians are not afraid islamic terrorists are more prone rise against them than cower from them mumbai went back work the very next day after general indian people feel collective sense fuck you terror groups that instills sense collective confidence but indian people are afraid the rss and its families affected the way speak live think and make friends especially the last few years has found out how tough even maintain familiy bonds when discussing this topic see altogether how many friends have been lost uncles ignored and even fathers and mothers distanced from because how divisive the air has become the rss and its families make far more afraid people than all the islamic terrorists ever have through effective political mobilization and through ensuring they don get arrested for terror terror tricks fate they enjoy what islamic terrorists don enjoy success influence and power knowledge though would say that people mix the rss and the other groups that come under the sangh parivar tough say who more violent than the others but names like the vhp hindu mahasabha bajrang dal are key players note this distinction the rss ideological hub but may not the one directly coordinating acts terrorizing india maybe that title could the abvp lynching family demands 691783 html who create climates fear and intimidation every university they are the vhp who are most prominent valentine day less this year though the bajrang dal hindu mahasabha this group actively massacred muslims front gandhi during the partition riots difficult say who worse than the other and not sure myself you might find that the rss link more causal than direct many attacks indian citizens view they well all their supporters are guilty creating climate terror ,1

 read answer quora but direct links aren allowed here just paste the answer here though the images the answer are lost also don agree with the answer completely but interesting counterpoint the general viewpoint have about hindutva question why did veer sawarkar form hindu mahasabha was atheist answer culture the physical manifestation individual spiritual immortality humans despite our mortal bodies crude natures flawed minds are luminous beings who can exist for millennia travel across oceans will and speak entire generations once under the right conditions for this one only one condition must met the individual must overcome their delusions mortality instead identify with immortal reality once that done all else follows the primary fallacy the average atheist makes the course their reading their belief that they somehow slipped off the chains religion delusion developed some sort individualistic freedom that nonsense the only thing they done exchange one set chains for another there absolutely difference between the rituals organized religion the flag marches communism for that matter liberal socialism there heaven religious liberal there was never any heaven merely duty never ending thankless duty part unknowing all knowing greater being with sense individual good evil even indifference that what the bhagavad gita actually says that what liberals don understand human beings want have part greater whole this sentiment the very basis humanity its civilizations its ethos religion like all ideologies merely another set lies meant justify the existence yet another unjust exploitative society because all societies their very collective existence are unjust exploitative the individual but that okay because human beings either want exploit exploited themselves even the holy liberals are bound their own set untruths and thus must constantly justifying arguing over group nonentities they not see that their stand absolute knowledge different from that adopted the christians muslims when they were persecuting being persecuted the pagans who preceded them there not single argument liberals have that hasn been raised ten thousand times earlier thomas aquinas lao tzu the buddha himself the mahabharata there not single argument the god delusion that hasn been discussed far more exhaustively dedicatedly comprehensively the tripitakas there isn single criticism the bible that wasn known countered thomas aquinas the individuals concerned thomas aquinas the buddha were not only far more intelligent learned enlightened than your liberal thinks they were all probability some the most intelligent beings grace this species the idea that they were foolish enough fall under some sort superstitious nonsense ridiculous they believe because choose chose order defend our chosen group the virtues sins this group whether this group christians hindus muslims even the people known certain circles sickulars don even figure this equation “for after all how know that two and two make four that the force gravity works that the past unchangeable both the past and the external world exist only the mind and the mind itself controllable – what then ” thus clearly see that the tribe the fundamental necessity well the ultimate goal human existence how this tribe defines itself called culture this culture turn can defined multiple factors race religion the communist manifesto the mein kampf nietzsche the god delusion course organized religion any tribe virtue the numerical superiority philosophical strength provides its members superior any number individuals thus dominates the latter through slaughter plunder therein lies the crux why the three great monotheistic faiths christianity islam judaism have destroyed virtually every single pagan faith the world save for india china paganism simply not robust enough ideology effectively bind people together too individualistic offers too many choices has too many freedoms don mistake freedom for the lack oppression murdering babies though that might been pure roman anti carthiginian propaganda burning widows which was the british digging nearly extinct traditions anti hindu propaganda are oppression but they not connote lack freedom the mere allowing choice within one spiritual thus cultural fabric paganism weakens the tribe thus paves the way for its own demise then why did india china survive the answer simple what the biggest factor that sets india china apart from the world and thus our hordes have given these two civilizations the immortality not even eternal egypt mighty rome could aspire like dragons outfought our pagan foes like monkeys cheated the mongol tumens like rats out bred our civilized monotheist oppressors thus survived but this state affairs could never continued for ever fertility rates fall schools open teach new lies place old ones people their eternal search for suffering hanker after new more horrifying tortures what people forget that leaving their religion they are effectively abandoning their own culture thus the very basis human civilization true they gain better softer society society more amenable individualistic bliss but such state affairs can only temporary before such hedonistic loosely bound members are swept away hard unthinking orthodoxy hindus long protected from the depredations islam christianity their vast population multifarious ethnic divisions warlike nature the early 1900s were open such culturalization thanks several events not under this answer purview thus was evident any well read indian the early 1900s that india concept was doomed extinction all said and done india hindu concept created hindus populated hindus defined hindus don give that secular nonsense hinduism like all indo european faiths does not correlate morality with divinity and thus shows tolerance for other religions unknown any faith currently existing earth yes even buddhism christians would got with their belief mythical jerusalem muslims would gone praying arab stone but india india are neither israel arabia and thus was born hindutva racial pride for made race one believed cultural pride for non existent culture land with millions civilizational pride for civilization that had long passed into legend fallen into barbarism religious pride for made religion that had carved out from the very forces meant oppose what savarkar being atheist real atheist unlike the anti national conformist phonies quora the indian liberals realized was that hinduism was unlikely survive for long merely account being pagan faith and with hinduism would gone the very essence india think yourself there are thousands dance traditions india how many them are islamic origin how many are christian origin how many ragas have the communists authored what good have the hordes the indian media done for humanity after one thousand years what good would bunch shouting news anchors have accomplished and yet play the same raga bhairavi the emperor samudragupta once played his veena thousand years before the first ship sailed around africa the same raga ustad bismillah khan performed every day the ghats varanasi until few years ago thus savarkar remade hinduism from christianity came the purpose violence militaristic organization from islam came the stress ideological purity defensiveness from judaism came the emphasis free enterprise racial religious existence the world oldest religion was reforged the very image the newest order withstand new crueller more ignorant humanity what did was different from what ataturk did when rebuilt new turkey form the ashes the ottoman porte when mao took the most bitter war torn people the world recast them into united china was nationalist everything did was for the nation for posterity judge his actions not but judge his intentions his character judged intellectual pygmies who haven had single original thought their own veer savarkar deserves better ,1

 not bjp supporter they haven earned trust and they probably won and don have context for all the points raised only try answer the ones able \ deal 2007 2014 that literally more than one term government tactics change after each term meet the pressing political scenario \ antics played incompetent opposition maintain the resemblance that they actually opposition \ 2011 the was ruling and the bjp felt that afspa couldn removed under that government the second part understanding that they would have used the legislature start the process get rid article 370 they had had majority the government \ politics nothing new see here modi met bose one relatives this year and said would consider which obviously stalling tactic \ opposition being obstructive opposition \ there real intent probably trying please the industries who would have shell out cash for improvements their drainage systems also not allowing ash dumping the river would virtually make people arms against the government years gives them lot leeway \ they were against but nandan nilekani met the and pitched him managing convince him let the program stay that what read the news month two after the elections took place \ politicians being politicians \ revenge for voting aap power hurts see the tamasha that happening the moment grant full state hood delhi and stalling the aap becomes impossible aap also incompetent and complains too much but that different topic \ you quote august 2013 article before and april 2013 after seriously don even see fucking turn because the bjp helped the congress pass the bill bjp turn black money before lakh after jumla \ citations your part but narendra modi had said that there much abroad that bringing back would enough give lakhs everyone that doesn mean promised give everyone lakhs \ they were really two faced about this all the while when they opposed they actually helped the congress push the bill through the lok sabha \ obvious case want score political points \ don see how allowing fdi equivalent allowing privatization privatization only happens they allow the private sector control the system \ just politics they didn lower the limit can called turn \ their excuse adequate planning the budget would take another month and cost lot money \ continuation policies quite normal see that happen \ opposition being opposition name one country where the opposition doesn turn once power \ government doesn endorse his view \ don fucking see net neutrality either article don fucking slap words just because you want 66a during the legal process the government was the defendant couldn withdraw the litigation anything the sort the case was continuing from upa2 and belief that the government counsel told the government that the only thing they could that stage was defend and not suddenly change their opinion ,-1

 don know modi has direct hand this not but his ministers and party members along with many saffron gangs absolutely does have doubt about very cunningly never acts against admonishes right wing loonies inside the bjp like muzaffarnagar rioters giriraj singh adityanath etc instead rewards them with cabinet positions follows similar pattern for the nationalism charade well these are the signs dictatorship not democracy past behavior the best predictor future behavior gujarat left stone unturned create personality cult revolving around him wants have the same cult national level encouraging people like arnab goswami who build this image further and further even enlisted mukesh ambani say something the lines not intellectual patriot you think this attitude will bite bjp 2019 hope the election will teach the bjp lesson ,1
and there are some commenter twitter and elsewhere who are saying things like modi should intervene etc they really think the guy who spent 5000 crores black money win the elections thinks what happened here wrong probably will punish the guy for getting caught and the bjp wallahs will say our modi great doesn tolerate this when the opposite the truth recent tweet kejriwal bjp expels dagar will they also expel all those who appear future stings don think they have any more videos but guess any other bjp mlas members who made similar offers must shitting their pants right now ,1

does the really need explanation many years ago after the godhra carnage vir sanghvi former editor the hindustan times made once lifetime confession about how the indian media reports communal violence details aspx key 611 the answer suspect that are programmed see hindu muslim relations simplistic terms hindus provoke muslims suffer when this formula does not work clear now that well armed muslim mob murdered unarmed hindus simply not know how cope shy away from the truth that some muslims committed act that indefensible and resort blaming the victims course there are always ‘rational reasons’ offered for this stand muslims are minority and therefore they deserve special consideration muslims already face discrimination why make harder for them you report the truth then you will inflame hindu sentiments and this would irresponsible and this something most indian journalists believe but few would ever admit public forum because they know not morally justifiable view outside their ideological circle that why sanghvi was widely attacked his profession when wrote this article and not just journalists but most indian public figures who talk about interfaith and communal issues they follow these same compromises their secular idealogy mainly political construct not true secularism and hence there implicit agreement compromise when comes what they see lesser evils like muslim fundamentalists non bjp parties pandering such fundamentalists they see their duty remain silent about even support such people for the sake what they see more important goal fight the sangh parivar majoritarianism the name secularism they condone communalism ,1

 totally against any sort crime and attacking someone the name cow punishable though this stance hate most the cow related posts here the reason because the cow related stories and discussions happening here far has failed tell the ground reality the crime scene which usually told any crime stories what did police was the mob arrested not not the police supporting the mob why this not reported higher police officials these are some the basic questions answered any crime incidents but don see them the stories about cow related violence just see plain emotions and name calling something like mudiji must answer kind responses feel like this should stop get more support from mainstream masses ,-1

 what would releasing video footage achieve the people that aren’ convinced official announcement the dgmo will dismiss and video footage photos “doctored” just easily this absolutely correct the intention doubt the narrative amount evidence going convince anyone otherwise second the fencing along the loc all indian til this true were there pakistani contributions all towards the fence that unbelievable and finally very possible that modi lulled the pakistanis into false sense security with the indus waters treaty bluff and the let fight war poverty instead speech kozhikode they may have raised alert levels for week following the attack but those would been dialed down once they were convinced that india was all talk and action was masterpiece deception and timing maybe but all the things you said far this was far the weakest would assume this just modi being passive aggressive his foreign policy instead playing some diabolical chess with pakistan the tactical impact may negligible but the strategic and political implications are immense india has now shown that she can – and will – respond provocations with force your opinion you think has happened earlier the congress said something week the effect raids happened during congress time also didn parrot around after something gen deepak kapoor said want know how much their statements are valid and how many are invalid asking you this because after there were similar questions surgical strike ece began coming out something that you can really see today the idsa has written good pieces advocating for more muscular policy against terrorists following which you can read here 11theisraeliwayandrelevanceforindia sscrajiv 261109 modi initial attempts diplomacy with pakistan were ensure that peace was given chance that’ why invited sharif his inauguration and made “surprise visit” lahore for further talks after the pathankot attack took the unprecedented step allowing pakistani investigation team into the base gave the pakistanis chance prove that things had indeed changed and that state support for terrorism would cease that turned out not the case the investigators had the nerve suggest that the attack was false flag operation orchestrated india yes india needs have the carrot and the stick while dealing with any its more antagonistic partners neighbors more concerned with the fact that our troops are getting killed ways troops not get killed during peacetime these kinds things being the norm are unacceptable india shouldn allow this area thorn its side any longer marks sea change from the previous policy seeking cessation hostilities through diplomatic means alone and persisting with the notion that diplomacy would work one day even though had failed for the past seventy years contradict you bit opinion the current government for various reasons elections indirect message pakistan whatever opts publicize their diplomatic and foreign policy actions through the media and other sources has been the policy india far understated its approach through foreign policy think india becoming more overtly aggressive now control the narrative easier since the tide opinions that matter public media political can always turn instant this may advised ill advised tell you which context this would ill advised currently india flexed muscles and attacked terrorists the pok some time later group carried out some attacks urban india and caused catastrophic damage life property and morale what would india they claimed show courage and pro activity dismantling hostile forces our backyard but what these forces recoup and attack would deeply humiliating and shocking correct this risk always exists this surgical strike isn end point india needs play its cards smarter and the worst part don think the indian government even has positive experience controlling the narrative could wrong this could all blow its face instant and the entire image they cultivating could pop was would publicize the surgical strikes and compare the attacks that pakistan military itself faced the pns mehran kamra the nfwp from terrorists that did not happen hoped modi would like india and pakistan face attacks their military from these terrorists hope that our mission helps innocent soldiers both sides the border from threats life sounds reasonable head playing pakistani emotion and love for raheel sharif who credit where its due stomped and killed terrorism plaguing karachi much could their soldiers died shareef took retaliatory action indian soldiers died modi took retaliatory action fairs fair right just want you address this one thing your post the false narrative that the attackers were anguished kashmiris fighting indian oppression entirely possible but unless there ready proof for choose assume its false narrative enjoy your gold buddy ,1

here the thing about meritocracy when you systematically subdue particular section society creating multiple hurdles their socio educational advancement you are rewarded with less competition for the sought after jobs and seats educational institutes since the said sections society are longer able compete against you this like breaking the legs your opponent before the race that you can later win the race merit what affirmative action does removes the disability imposed that particular section society reserving fair share seats for example what proportion seats would have been occupied scs who constitute the population had they not been treated like dirt for thousands years yes exactly what proportion would have been occupied women had they been treated like actual human beings with actual brains exactly before you start guessing let tell you general category male and support not but seats for women both jobs education and parliament assemblies real meritocracy everyone should able compete without the disabilities imposed them society compared the privileged sections when compete for job with others don want take seat which would have otherwise gone woman but got that seat just because society thinks men are more meritorious the reservation based economic criteria sure dubious almost entire india earns less than 8lpa 8lpa poor then mukesh ambani middle class ,1

you are simpleton and have been victim superficial propaganda you think bjp and its supporters including have such retarded things beef mandir etc our agenda its all media hype with only the whackos taking these petty issues seriously its the low hanging fruit for the lowest common denominator sane person the bjp camp even talks about these things hard bjp supporter including their religious agenda and let tell you brief how think greentext tiem india highly fragmented feudal and poor only ideologies make this diverse bunch behave like country slavery the name gandhi hindutva search your feelings and history and you know true ridiculous that foreign woman from different race religion country continent born and raised under different set cultural values for decades can come here under the banner gandhi and almost accepted our prime minister and was definitely accepted the head the most powerful political party india for over decade country diverse india predicted west balkanize somehow went through its bankruptcy and came out single nation state reason hindutva hinduism slavery name gandhi strong the abomination from the foreign whore literally cannot talk straight for than minutes literally makes sense all congress wants him the next prime minister their friends media intellectual circles and corporations end supporting him because they despise hindutva for real imagined reasons clearly congress has done and will more damage the country than hindutva can even imagine have good leaders hindutva modi and shah modi has actually proven himself gujarat done good work spread out over decade these can separate the rhetoric from reality advani was too much mandir movement modi uses hindutva gather support but does per wants good pragmatic politician now the rest how muslims must behave something according anyone who supports congress the enemy our nation state doesn matter how you give your allahus your akbars how you shove your jesus your christ how believing chubby kid with talking elephant head gives you meaning life you support congress then you are traitor book and you must eliminated any means necessary you support any other party then willing tolerate right now destruction neutralization the congress support infrastructure across political social and economic circles should our top priority now assuming the congress support infrastructure destroyed then and only then and not before rss becomes problem must eliminate them replaced better trained and equipped police force under independent judiciary but with covert powers hindu intellectuals become problem must eliminate them anyone who tries add religious talk education gets ass fucked hindu muslim christian cow piss magic bullshit earth 6000 years old and being pedo under special situations totally bro talk can and about this but won for the purposes this thread these points are enough and about ram mandir the rightfully hindu territory and will have back time the hate muslims have for american christian troops for polluting their sacred land mecca official motivation bin laden apparently the same hate hindus have against muslims for polluting our sacred land ayodhya only its worse our case because christians churches are not actually present inside mecca but muslims mosques are actually present the site ayodhya its also worse because christians came saudi arabia with the consent the government king whatever but muslims are staying ayodhya when have clearly stated that don want them there don give fuck where muslims choose live and build mosques india but atleast leave our sacred temples alone you motherfuckers don understand how this even for debate babri mosque culturally pretty insignificant muslims some mosque made name king but ayodhya and ram mandir are culturally extremely important for hindus the city 7th avatar vishnu who the preserver part the supreme being holy shit just give that small piece land and let worship our heroes and their flying monkey sidekicks why won muslims give possible that muslims think even the destruction single mosque for good infidel cause anywhere the world means that the holy war islam against infidels just took step back and that cannot allowed happen just imagine how much peace would there muslims let build our temple like holy shit can achieve many different goals simultaneously creates good impression hindu community discourages communal politics throughout india makes leaders like advani irrelevant rss and bjp loses good part its support you can emotionally blackmail hindus the future for reservations something this genius political and cultural move and yet muslims won this makes seriously question the loyalties muslims community seriously think they will demand another pakistan their numbers are high enough well just hope muslims begin rape and pillage europe soon that might see how the west reacts godhra style riot happens the west then they lose the moral right tell brownskins how deal with muslims and that gives our hindu right government that much free hand whatever the fuck wants ,1

 continuing from the kashmir post where comments were locked think there are some routes that can taken article 35a removal this very controversial article probably utmost importance least according what hear and read arbitrarily gives the state legislature powers that have place the kind democracy functioning india our democracy has been often criticized quasi federal federal with unitary bias because ours was experiment that had never even been conceived let alone tried anywhere the world land with multitudes language cultures and religions function democracy would either fall apart turn into autocracy the majority were the prevailing views 1947 there reason usa placed itself strategically closer pakistan hypothesized its homogeneity would help grow faster and remain stable india belied all their hopes the reason sheer ingenuity our constitution and inhuman capabilities our earlier leaders kashmir throughout remained out the loop due the very article question the example berlin before 1989 when east and west berlin existed eastern half was under communist regime ussr and the western under three nations usa and france the west was developed under open market economics while being financially helped the three nations east simultaneously remained stagnant and suffered akin the other balkan nations the easterners could see the west developing and wanted flee that side much that east germany government built the historic berlin wall could for starters remove the article 35a and allow free movement every sense accord with the constitution the kashmiris would want whats happening say mumbai bangalore than multan even bloody sinkiang region china thus exposure the wide world and idea what lies fully integrated himachal pradesh often the highest preforming state many indexes revered and often read immediate neighbor kashmir they won even have far and manage that who knows pok revolts join the mainstream kashmir just like the berlin wall fell 1989 must prove action time for theory crafting long past for investors shying away keynesian economics state where private investment dries public investment must step our government can spend 3600 cores statue with roi sight developing state the very breathing living people constitutionally bound serve will always find funds education due article 35a not many good schools could operate ratio the population demand the kashmiri pandit exodus drove away the majority educated populace this resulted young children aged attending madarsas for education when they graduated the age nearly years indoctrination resulted jilted attitude towards the nation large and extreme religious outlook the maulvis these madarsas often instilled separatist and jihadist thoughts inside these very impressionable brains also the lack exposure the rest the country meant these could not washed away when society taught something without external stimuli they become sounding boards for each other and and reinforce their self imposed thoughts painstakingly long process but probably the only one these are some the \ points could think right now but there are many many ways can bring them back internet the last remaining democracy let loose the jio adventure them when they see the lifestyle average mumbai bangalore citizen and compare with that any big pakistani city average citizen mind you they will know where secularism will lead and where religious indoctrination you can wish away disaster nor fight with weapons idea and very destructive idea has made home their brains what must slowly but surely ,1

responsibility and wife would have bring the children and educate them she must educated muslims are all terrorists they should sent back pakistan saudi arabia not terrorists but the general vibe that they are upto good and should careful around them the fact that they were uprooted only one generation back 1947 has reflected this mentality don blame them christians just want convert you exact opposite they love christians enrolled convent has culture indian kulcha best kulcha exact opposite they believe that india has culture speak regards the mentality the indian people they have

 2002 narendra modi the current india and then rss hardliner mismanaged riot and turned into state sponsored pogrom gave the rioters free hand and several his mlas and ministers were convicted rioting instigating the riots and giving the rioters list muslim owned houses was investigated special investigation team sit report exonerates modi the highlights 473243 html appointed the supreme court india under congress government and cleared all guilt another court later upheld this verdict one major reason lost was the fact that was deemed too moderate and ‘anti hindu’ while this probably some the reason lost should mentioned here that the results were total surprise everyone and contradicted the polls quite bit one the hindu right going vote for congress and turnout was still somewhat high though modi had campaigned these things and tried more moderate and economic focused the first few years lost track far all the major policies under him have either been economic foreign policy related the only major social policies under him have been letting the court making rulings social policy without interference homosexuality triple talaq and repealing the hajj subsidy due rise right wing nationalism there were multiple lynchings muslims which modi was silent the cow lynchings part absolutely true they have risen since got elected however modi has condemned lynchings indias modi condemns violence name cow worship iduskbn19k13s though criticizing him the speed his response valid point fake news say hasn condemned the government also demonetized the economy late 2016 win elections don think was win and haven really heard that until now the government claims have done for variety reasons overall the effects seem the government has failed its objective make harder launder money demonetization caused significant dip gdp growth the objective reduce terrorism was achieved naxalite communist terrorists were forced surrender masse some areas though whether this trend has sustained debated addition tax collection increased and continuing the increase the party currently using terrorist attacks for political gains they responded terror attack likely backed pakistan attacking terrorists they have done this twice the first which confirmed video while the second which contested idea how striking back can construed some sort exploitation event congress party has some nutty policies they barely have policies the bjp stands for something while the congress stands for getting the congress power the party has been ruled historically corrupt political dynasty for bit now and functions making populist promises well appealing certain demographics usually their winning coalition consists minority religions which why they blocked shah bano certain castes hindus and any farmers they can win over they usually will propose some sort pro farmer policies right now they playing the role opposition party fairly well but almost too well they just contradicted everything the bjp has said without offering too much platform past pure populism there couple people who are actual true heart congress believers but for most people matter substance and some corruption better worse than hindu nationalism these parties want wreck the indian economy and are supported ‘economists’ from leftist indian universities while this absolutely true throw the commies bone here like the bjp and unlike the congress they actually stand for something and are fairly noncorrupt they been ruling the state kerala for while now and the state has some really really good indicators good fact one the few examples communists can point when asked about the success communism don really have responses past this point just expressing thoughts individual parties tmc this one more just ranting than actual response mamata herself congress the extreme while congress this election has been adopting soft hindutva which basically translates visiting temples mamata has like said been accused various anti hindu things not mention outright forbidding processions for fairly important hindu holiday allow muslim holiday continue without fear violence bahujan samaj party takes advantage casteist feelings the extreme indian politics identity politics the bjp tries make blocs vote religion and congress does caste whoever wins the lower caste hindu like india white working class swing vote vote wins the election bsp caste based politics turned party for low castes precipitated giving low castes more power for those you who don know india has what republicans think affirmative action the states namely they reserve certain number seats colleges and government jobs for minorities and more importantly historically underpriviledged castes now you get situations where historically privileged castes vote blocs get reservation status and certain castes are thrown under the bus they were historically priv but don have enough numbers significant voting bloc and ofc mayawatis solution give upper castes cms reservation too ncp ncp the nationalist congress party like the congress ncp also social democratic but also appeals indian civic nationalism the party opposed sonia gandhi being congress leader the party opposes indian citizens ‘unnatural’ origins from holding public offices that why was created sonia longer leader and they just usually form coalition with congress they probably close the center but still secular shiv sena you hit this one pretty much right the nail also like say the gujurat riots the one modi was blamed for prompted the leader the shiv sena call muslims cancer aam admi party along with bjp congress and left this the only party with national name recognition lol they literally confined delhi and like other states where they have legislative presence basically delhi aap just talked lot about because indian liberals love and the idea also the left doesn have ton real presence either they have about seats the lok sabha combined tdp this one fairly accurate and pretty sad honest the direction the party pretty free floating andhra needs some development after losing hyderabad aimim– aimim the islamic equivalent the bjp seeks establish islamic democracy india and often resorts hate based rhetoric like advocating genocide more like the islamic equivalent the shiv sena also they only somewhat relevant their

 lot people here are talking about the case let clarify few things there were two judgments that were written justice saini special judge cbi for the matter one was concerning raja and the other the directors loop essar telecom company with respect raja there was definitely arbitrariness with respect how the spectrum licenses were given out multiple advisory the internal staff and the telecom regulatory authority were ignored 2012 the supreme court agreed and canceled all the allotted licences that extent raja complicit but that can just written off saying that first there was explicit law that bars the telecom minister from not doing second raja can very well incompetent minister but that not crime constitute crime one has show any qui pro quo for what had done the second part extremely hard prove didn really for himself but for his party donations which are governed separate laws that gives favorable anonymity even though has been led off the hook special judge has more with the nature the crime than the innocence the criminal shall refrain from commenting the second judgment for now ,1

the problem with these insane auction revenue that the money eventually comes out our pockets basically the government taking huge loan with emis and forcing the people pay back both principal and interest some private company that they have control over the low cost the licenses helped boost mobile penetration across the country from million 2004 375 million 2008 670 million 2012 the lowered cost calls from increased competition allowed poorer sections get connected despite the rupee plunging from inr 2008 inr 2012 ever since the licenses were cancelled the cost voice calls has gone multiple times spectrum was auctioned the highest bidder years ago and were supposed have 150 million subscribers 2014 but all managed was measly million and coverage concentrated the cities and most rural areas don even have the option using even they are willing pay for but all the money from the bwa auctions ended being spent schemes like fsb aaadhar subsidising loss making psus like air india bsnl etc windfall auctions are never good for the consumers large because thanks the huge amounts invested upfront which are usually bank loans taken the companies they try recover much money possible the earliest and that means higher prices for everyone until they start making profits the same thing happened with auctions europe where telcos bid massive amounts the auctions and then failed roll out networks and went begging the govt change the license terms and allow the operators share networks etc meet coverage goals these coal auctions are worse because the central govt allocates the coal blocks and all the money goes the states which may may not have actual use for the money instead coming viable development schemes that get funding from japan etc now the states will able spend all this money any hare brained scheme that the party power can choose promote and unlike spectrum where both the businesses and the end consumers are located the same area coal consumers are not necessarily located the state that producing them people other parts the country end pumping money coffers the coal producing states governments and will not even see the benefits the 15lakh crores that going collected from them edit here opinion piece pointing out other flaws the system the auctions 115021601818 html edit2 not defending upa practice handing out spectrum coal mines their friends just pointing out the flaws going with the highest bidder shows shortsightedness the part the government short term good for the govts the day may lead long term pains and losses for the country large more other reply ,1

good effort sad see you got downvoted will copy post made response your turn post some legit turns but quite few are just clutching straws look the talks with pakistan one for instance what talks have been held the months they have been power inviting shariff the swearing talks look afspa bjp just saying the things will lifted when needed how turn the fdi insurance issue also linked quora here what says bjp today said there will consensus passing insurance bill the government does not agree retain the fdi cap per cent against the proposed per cent the insurance bill was first introduced the rajya sabha 2008 but the government has not been able build consensus the cabinet cleared the increase the limit october 2012 the parliamentary standing committee finance had however suggested that the cap kept per cent interestingly enough this along with quite few other purported turns were actually turns the upa these had been mooted the nda the first place there are too many for point point rebuttal like said there have been quite few legit turns but lot that list just rabble rousing out date like orop all that aside very childish not saying you and naive thought process say all political parties only stall parliament they showboat they drama but behind the scenes work goes think about despite having minority govt with very strong communist contingent passed about 300 odd bills the upa passed similar number bills upa did see spectacular decline but that was because all those scams just log jammed parliament even the current opposition read much about their opposition the lab and now maybe gst but many other bills have sailed through both houses don buy into the rhetoric that all parties stall they congress bjp whoever they choose couple bills for political reasons while the rest quietly passed ,1

the media paid articles are paid known fact that the media under congress bjp tried align some section the media towards themselves but only one channel supporting them they are mocked ridiculed and discredited the highest levels the other channels congress ready everything possible discredit and undermine the current gov nda making some very good changes like demo gst adhaar these changes are highly detrimental congress survival they know that these are successful their chances making money through corruption would bleak they are doing everything pull him but guess what they have touch with the reality the reality very different ,1

 customary disclaimer about how patriotic indian concerned about the state affairs country the recent exchanges between the indian and the pakistani armed forces and how the governments both countries have used certain narratives highly troublesome opinion after the pulwama attack india claimed that iaf attacked jem camp and called preemptive attack simultaneously amit shah going around the country election campaigns and citing revenge and teach lesson his speeches asking for votes these are very contradicting outlooks and while all being lapped engaged and enraged audience puts serious question marks the integrity the current government pakistan the other hand has said suffered damages the iaf attack there are stories air raid site casualties mysterious madrassa 190227183058957 html going around where claimed that the iaf just destroyed some trees since then they have also circulated videos indian pilot captivity and mostly the rhetoric has been how being treated with respect and care now coming what really concerns that the citizens both countries are failing see through the political narratives already embarrassing for india that while delayed accepting any indian pilot being captured there were videos circulating online proving biggest fear right now that more proof comes forward the iaf strike not achieving much further questions are asked will become ego issue for modi inch chest and will see more retaliation and this retaliation mind you will not have much effect the kashmir issue terrorism but will pandering voter base pakistanis the other hand the light these skirmishes have completely forgotten that fairly established fact today that their government and military have created environment where harbouring terrorists and denying the same the norm and the pakistani government and military shifting the spotlight from that onto exchanges with india and how unfair india its assessments writing this post with appeal for citizens both countries see beyond political agendas and realise that war even these skirmishes are very dangerous for two countries which should basically focussing growth want encourage debate how make citizens more aware and how not fall for politically motivated narratives and ofcourse heavily biased media both sides not helping the cause will for sure get some flak for questioning the veracity the iaf attacks the jem camp but find worthy questioning don think today day and age with widespread access internet nothing destroyed camp and almost 300 dead terrorists has leaked onto the internet even pakistan whole country collectively tried hide that news would prove quite difficult but hope most redditers can move beyond that and understand the real concern behind questioning that ,1

while bad paper the current scenario actually better than expected the fact that banks have bad loans ancient fact life these loans extend many many places from large firms small farmers was always expected that some government would have intervene ecentually fix this the nda who has handle and fully expect them handle the issue itself resolved the bureaucrats and the bankers with the goi firmly the driving seat but the issue always the release bank funds largesse mainstay indian politics one form the other one the unspoken rules the game far the divestiture psus stronger oversight capital norms means constrain loans will help the clean banks will good thing and will allow for loan cycle occur the base healthy banking sector which can handle any future negative shock honestly this business expected good that people are upset but being upset won make difference since this essentially cyclical feature the larger economy and our banking private network rules which are followed divestment distance between center politics and psu management are the cure and they been the cure since the reform process started but haven been completed ,1

even though was and still dead against demo that isn reason for vote against them problem isn with the bjp the opposition throw all the shit you want them join you too but the question arises then what who next congress fuck local parties bsp tmc dmk aiadmk cpm rjd fuck again there just isn any other alternative and make matters worse bjp has slipped couple issues but what has the opposition done hold them accountable nothing they are highly disorganised and have clue there way like see them power because they don have spine aap whines too much they aren mature yet don think anyone would trust them with national policies educational and health are fine but foreign policy with aap don want kejri playing the victim card global stage this would resonate with many people who voted going vote for bjp the opposition spineless and clueless would stupid give them mandate this point let those shits learn the hard way and grow fucking spine till then are stuck with bjp could change things cong manages win might give them some space breath even bjp manages come second there assuming bsp wins then its easy write off congress for 2019 too this just bjps time let them enjoy actually good thing because without this back back wins for the bjp opposition would have remained blind let them learn the hard way ,1

 would like add few points would much venture and say the media had studied indian media 2014 they would have learnt lot lessons before the elections don belittle the opposition and anybody who has opposing view point the left liberal narrative india was and rss agent out kill muslims and slay the christian infidel you can see echoes this this day where the 2014 elections are derided victory for communal forces though the 150 million votes who voted nda are all bloodthirsty bigots accept the opposing view point give them listen understand what they want what they aspire what drives them vote for the candidate they want vote for not dismiss out hand then prevents you from formulating appropriate response the people not vote some esoteric principles they vote for access roti kapada aur pani leave alone makaan you can talk yourselves blue the face some ndtv discussion your studio about the principles the idea india the fact remains the majority vote because they want see person given them full belly some clean water drink and some decent clothes wear you can give this them they will vote you out the upa misread this entirely and utterly did the nda the indian media continues misread esp the left liberals the country they don care what happens some jnu president they care about themselves and their families finito even here not enough that understand the person the average voter wants but the motives that drive the person chose the leader crucial understand the electorate you are longer the only media source out there even years ago the media houses wrote the news scripted agendas and created narratives today world shitty forward from your next door unkil has more currency for the average citizen than some amazing passionate well written oped amartya sen aravind panagriya sad but the truth this can cut both ways can force good you can easily rile large sections the populace with well timed well crafted shitty whatsapp tweet either ways the fact remains that news media has competition and crowd sourced high time they woke which brings subpoint allow opposing view point primetime media starting 2012 all the media houses bar none till times now shifted towards modi midway into the 2014 campaign followed the exact same homogenous template which resulted the exact same things being said modi won even nominated will moderate now that modi nominated will hung parliament needing regional politicians seats hence modi will replaced now that modi has won and here the pendulum swung the other extreme will create this super small cabinet plutocrats and forth point 100 the mainstream english media said the exact same things resulting homogenity news that drowned out anything that the real world was feeding back them these are all the exact same mistakes the media and liberal establishment made with trump not case the indian media and liberal establishment learning from 2016 but the media and liberals should have learnt from india 2014 ,1

this what people who compare modi 2014 campaign with trump campaign fail realise trump campaigned platform explicit xenophobia racism and sexism didn hide anything about and that why most likely will win again because there was little scope losing hope him for his base modi was different him and his party history aside his campaign was the back huge anti incumbency against congress upa and modi came promising jobs and development and better standard living excluding minor dog whistling never ran hindutva candidate ever and big portion the who voted for him did because they wanted corruption free government that worked for the people the youth wanted jobs and controlled inflation prices the farmers wanted respectable wage for their year long hard work and what did modi let the hindutva crazies run loose and they started killing muslims and lynching dalits for their cow slaughter did the great leader much open his mouth the right time nope when did condemn those people was either too late too meek and each time the sangh parivar fired back that had disappointed them ended erecting government show and drama government theater which lacked any substance there many things could have done with majority everywhere except the rajya sabha but did not people are sick nehru and the congress being blamed for everything sick his lies sick his narcissism sick his refusal even acknowledge the negative aspects demonetisation sick him and his ministers trying brow beat every government organisation into submission people are absolutely disillusioned totally feel like 2019 going huge shock modi and vajpayee had good government and was far better leader and still lost 2004 don surprised this pompous ass and his team arrogant assholes lose again least will forced form minority government 2019 here hoping for good days ,-1
